## Installation ⚙️

Before running the project, make sure you have Python installed (version 3.7 or higher).

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/selvaganesh19/AI-study-planner.git
    cd AI-study-planner
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env` file:**  In the project's root directory, create a file named `.env` and add your OpenRouter API key:

    ```
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY
    OPENROUTER_MODEL=optional-model-name  # e.g., "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo"
    ```

    **Note:** Replace `YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` with your actual OpenRouter API key. You can get an API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
